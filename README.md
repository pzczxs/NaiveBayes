# Bayesian Naive Bayes Classifiers

The na√Øve Bayes (NB) classifier is a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on a common assumption that all features are independent of each other, given the category variable [2]. The different NB classifiers differ mainly by the assumptions they make regarding the distribution of features. The assumptions on distribution of features are called event models of the NB classifier [3]. For discrete features, multinomial or Bernoulli distributions are popular. These assumptions lead to two distinct models, which are often confused [4][5]. When dealing with continuous features, a typical assumption is Gaussian distribution.
